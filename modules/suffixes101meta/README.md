A module for analyzing all, matched, and unmatched suffixes for 101repo

# Details

These views are provided:

* filesBySuffix: The files in 101repo are grouped by suffix and ordered by frequency of suffix. Different sub-views are provided: all files, matched files (based on suffix), and unmatched files (based on suffix). 
* nunbersBySuffix: This is trivial summary of "filesBySuffix" where the lists of files is replaced by numbers of files for ease of exploration.
* numbersOfSuffixes: This is a trivial, even more harsh summary of "filesBySuffix" where there the numbers of all encountered suffixes, matched suffixes, and unmatched suffixes are shown.
