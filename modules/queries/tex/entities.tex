\section{Individuals of \solasote}
\label{S:entities}

The kinds of individuals in the ontology give rise to \solasote's set
of entity types, which we will discuss first. Then, we query the
ontology to look at illustrative representatives of each entity type.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Entity types}

There are these entity types:

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{type} & \textbf{comment}}{entityTypes}
%|

\noindent
For what it's worth, the list of entity types can be retrieved from
\solasote's triplestore as follows:

\sparql{entityTypes}

\noindent
That is, the types of individuals are organized as subclasses of a
base type \uri{onto:Entity}, but we do not include subclasses of the
\solasote-specific type \uri{onto:Classifier} because these are types
used for classification. This is explained in more detail in
\S\ref{S:classify}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Language'}

The following query retrieves all software language:

\sparql{languages}

\noindent
As there are many languages, we order them by `popularity' and show
only the most popular ones. By popularity we mean the numbers of any
sort of subjects referring to them through any sort of predicate. In
this manner, we see presumably more well-known, less obscure
individuals. Thus:

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{language} & \textbf{headline}}{7}{languages}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Technology'}

We apply the same kind of query as before:

\sparql{technologies}

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{technology} & \textbf{headline}}{7}{technologies}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Concept'}

We apply the same kind of query as before:

\sparql{concepts}

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{concept} & \textbf{headline}}{7}{concepts}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Vocabulary'}

Concepts can be collected in \emph{vocabularies}; see the `memberOf'
predicate in \S\ref{S:memberOf}. Let's have a look at the vocabularies:

\sparql{vocabularies}

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{vocabulary} & \textbf{headline}}{vocabularies}
%|

\sparql{haskellVocabulary}

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{concept} & \textbf{headline}}{7}{vocabularies}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Contribution'}

\solasote{} relies on the chrestomathy \ooo{} for evidence in the form
of small systems that exercise languages, technologies, and
concepts. These systems are called \emph{contributions}. We sort them
by popularity again:

\sparql{contributions}

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{contribution} & \textbf{headline}}{12}{contributions}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Feature'}

Contributions implement features of \ooo{}'s imaginary human resources
management system (the \ooo{system}; see the `implements' predicate in
\S\ref{S:implements}. We sort the features by popularity again:

\sparql{features}

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{feature} & \textbf{headline}}{features}
%|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Type `Theme'}

Contributions can be collected in \emph{themes}; see the `memberOf'
predicate in \S\ref{S:memberOf}. Let's have a look at the themes:

\sparql{themes}

\partialOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{theme} & \textbf{headline}}{7}{themes}
%|
