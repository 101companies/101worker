\Objective{The query should identify the concepts that are uniquely connected to specific programming paradigms}

\Output{Some sort of table per paradigm listing the most frequently occurring concepts.
Arguably, we also need to see a table of concepts that are not uniquely connected with one paradigm,
as it is this table that we need to use for debugging the wiki (such as by adding ignore-mentioning markup}

\Result{conceptsToParadigm}
