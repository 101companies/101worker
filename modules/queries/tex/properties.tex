\section{The properties of \solasote}
\label{S:properties}

\solasote's individuals are not just classified (see
\S\ref{S:classify}), but they are characterized in several other ways
through semantic properties in the sense of Semantic Web-like
triples. The underlying set of predicates is listed here:

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l|l|l}}{\textbf{predicate} & \textbf{comment}}{predicates}
%|

\noindent
For what it's worth, the list of predicates can be retrieved from
\solasote's triplestore as follows:

\sparql{predicates}

\noindent
Before we discuss these predicates in more detail, we should also
identify their types in the sense of the assumed domain and range for
each predicate:

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l|l|l}}{\textbf{predicate} & \textbf{domain} & \textbf{range}}{domainsAndRanges}
%|

\noindent
Again, for completeness' sake, the table has been produced by the
following query:

\sparql{domainsAndRanges}

\noindent
Now let's discuss these properties one by one, while also providing
typical examples. We pick a order so that perhaps the more obvious
predicates are discussed first:

\medskip

\noindent
\begin{description}

\item[uses] Systems (technologies and \ooo{}'s contributions) can make
  use of software languages, technologies, and concepts. Use of a
  language should be understood as `some artifact of the system being
  written in said language'. For instance:
  \sparql{exampleUsePredicate}
  \noindent
  Here, \uri{onto:haskellStarter} is a simple Haskell-based
  contribution to \ooo{}. Use of a technology should be understood as
  `the system being developed or executed with the help of said
  technology'. Use of a concept should be understood as `the concept
  being exercised or taken dependence on in the design or
  implementation of the system'.
