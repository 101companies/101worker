\section{The properties of \solasote}
\label{S:properties}

\solasote's individuals are not just classified (see
\S\ref{S:classify}), but they are characterized in several other ways
through semantic properties in the sense of Semantic Web-like
triples. The underlying set of predicates is listed here:

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l|l|l}}{\textbf{predicate} & \textbf{comment}}{predicates}
%|

\noindent
For what it's worth, the list of predicates can be retrieved from
\solasote's triplestore as follows:

\sparql{predicates}

\noindent
Before we discuss these predicates in more detail, we should also
identify their types in the sense of the assumed domain and range for
each predicate:

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l|l|l}}{\textbf{predicate} & \textbf{domain} & \textbf{range}}{domainsAndRanges}
%|

\noindent
Again, for completeness' sake, the table has been produced by the
following query:

\sparql{domainsAndRanges}

\noindent
Now let's discuss these properties one by one, while also providing
typical examples. We pick a particular order that fits convenience of
explanation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{sameAs, similarTo, linksTo} 

This is a family of predicates all concerned with linking individuals
of \solasote{} with external web-based resources, e.g., pages on
Wikipedia or resources according to DBpedia. Their meaning and purpose
is closely related to \uri{owl:sameAs}~\cite{owl} and variations that
are discussed by the Semantic Web community~\cite{HalpinHT11}. The use
of \uri{onto:sameAs} expresses that the \solasote{} individual and the
external resource's URL refer to the same thing. For instanceL

\sparql{predicateSameAs1}

\noindent
That is, there is an \solasote{} individual for the `Java Language
Specification' (JLS) of entity type \uri{onto:Document}; we use the
\uri{onto:sameAs} predicate to associate it with Oracle's authorative
source for the JLS.

The use of \uri{onto:similarTo} expresses that the \solasote{}
individual and the external's URL refer to closely related but notably
not the same things. An unspecific link to an external resource is
enabled by \uri{onto:linksTo}. We query some links for illustration:

\sparql{predicateSameAs2}

\completeOutputTabular{{l|l}}{\textbf{predicate} & \textbf{url}}{predicateSameAs2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{uses} 

Systems (i.e., technologies and \ooo{}'s contributions) can make use
of instruments (i.e., software languages, technologies, and
concepts). Use of a language should be understood as `some artifact of
the system being written in said language'. For instance:

\sparql{predicateUses1}

\noindent
Here, \uri{onto:haskellStarter} is a simple Haskell-based contribution
to \ooo{}. Use of a technology should be understood as `the system
being developed or executed with the help of said technology'. Use of
a concept should be understood as `the concept being exercised or
taken dependence on in the design or implementation of the
system'. For instance:

\sparql{predicateUses2}

\noindent
Here, \url{tech:JAXB}\footnote{... \uri{onto:sameAs}
  \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-140168.html}}
is the Java platform's technology for XML-data binding, which indeed
uses `Java annotations' for controling the mapping.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{partOf}

Whole-part relationships are used in many areas of modeling; they make
sense for \solasote, too. That is, some kinds of \solasote{}
individuals may be composites of other kinds of \solasote{}
individuals. For instance:

\sparql{predicatePartOf1}

\noindent
That is, the Java compiler,
\uri{tech:javac},\footnote{... \uri{onto:sameAs}
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javac}} is part of the Java
Development Kit, \uri{tech:JDK}.\footnote{... \uri{onto:sameAs}
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit}}. Operationally,
by installing JDK on a machine, one also gets the executable for the
Java compiler. Here is another example exercising another entity type
for whole-part relationships:

\sparql{predicatePartOf2}

\noindent
That is, the XPath query language for XML,
\uri{lang:XPath},\footnote{... \uri{onto:sameAs}
  \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/}} is part of the XSLT
transformation language for XML
Development Kit, \uri{lang:XSLT}.\footnote{... \uri{onto:sameAs}
  \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt}}. The `part of' relationship must not
be confused here with a `subset off' relationship. That is, by saying
XPath is part of XSLT, we refer to the fact that XPath expressions can
be used in certain operand position in an XSLT program. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{implements}

Systems (i.e., technologies and \ooo{}'s contributions) can implement
descriptions (i.e., features or documents). The idea is that the
descriptions serve essentially as requirements. For instance:

\sparql{predicateImplements1}

\noindent
Here, \uri{onto:haskellStarter} is again the simple Haskell-based
contribution to \ooo{}, which was exercised already earlier on. The
triple states that the contribution implements \uri{feature:Total} (a
feature for totaling all salaries in a company of \ooo{}'s
system). Here is another example:

\sparql{predicateImplements2}

\noindent
Here, \uri{tech:javac} refers to the `standard' Java compiler, as part
of JDK, and \uri{doc:JLS} refers again to the Java Language
Specification, as noted earlier. Clearly, the `standard' is supposed
to implement the language `standard'.
