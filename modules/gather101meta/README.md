A module to gather 101meta rules from 101repo

# Details

See the [Langauge:101meta specification](http://101companies.org/index.php/Language:101meta#Metadata_collection) for details on the aggregation of the rules. The module generates two files in 101results/101meta:

* filelist.txt: the list of files found with Ok/Fail indicator	
* rulelist.json: the list of rules with dirname and basename.

# Issues 

* No conversion from relative to absolute filenames performed.
