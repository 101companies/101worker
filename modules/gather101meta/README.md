A module to gather 101meta rules from 101repo

# Details

See the [Language:101meta specification](http://101companies.org/index.php/Language:101meta#Metadata_collection) for details on the aggregation of the rules. The module generates the file "rules.json" for the list of rules with dirname and basename within directory "101results/101meta".

# Issues 

* No conversion from relative to absolute filenames performed.
