# Headline

A module to aggregate 101meta metadata

# Details

All languages and all technologies exercised are represented by the summary such that each language and technology serves as a key for grouping all files associated with the language or technology.

# Dependencies

This module assumes that files have been matched by the module "match101meta".

# Issues 

* Tags other than languages, technologies to be served!
* Performance problems; mainly due to matching?!
* Top-level summaries only; per-directory summaries needed?
* Other issues to be identified!
