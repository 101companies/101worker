====================
Internationalization
====================

Jinja includes support for internationalized templates. Because usually the
application includes i18n/l10n code too there is no script to collect
translatable strings and no default translation interface. A simple
implementation wouldn't fit into every application so there are a few things
you have to do.


Writing A Translator
====================

The most important thing is writing a translator and subclassing the
Environment so that Jinja knows about the translator. Then you have to
think of how to resolve the current language. You probably use Jinja in a
multithreaded environment where each thread (request) might want to have
a different language. The best way is putting the current language into
the context, this can work automatically if you create a helper function
for template rendering. But that's up to you.

However. For many web applications this might be a way:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from jinja import Environment
    from myapplication import get_translator

    class ApplicationTranslator(object):

        def __init__(self, language):
            self.language = language
            self.translator = get_translator(language)

        def gettext(self, string):
            return self.translator.ugettext(string)

        def ngettext(self, singular, plural, n):
            return self.translator.ungettext(singuarl, plural, n)


    class ApplicationEnvironment(Environment):

        def get_translator(self, context):
            return ApplicationTranslator(context['LANGUAGE'])


    env = ApplicationEnvironment()
    tmpl = env.get_template('index.html')
    tmpl.render(LANGUAGE='de_DE')

This example assumes that you use gettext and have a gettext `Translations`
object which is returned by the `get_translator` function. But you don't
have to use gettext. The only thing Jinja requires is an object with to
functions/methods on it that return and accept unicode strings:
``gettext(string)`` that takes a string, translates and returns it, a
``ngettext(singular, plural, count)`` function that returns the correct plural
form for `count` items. Because some languages have no or multiple plural
forms this is necessary.


Translator Factory
==================

With Jinja 1.2 onwards it's possible to use a translator factory
instead of an enviornment subclass to create a translator for a context.
A translator factory is passed a context and has to return a translator.
Because of the way classes work you can also assign a translator class
that takes a context object as only argument as factory.

Example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from jinja import Environment
    from myapplication import get_translator

    def translator_factory(context):
        return get_translator(context['LANGUAGE'])

    env = ApplicationEnvironment(translator_factory=translator_factory)
    tmpl = env.get_template('index.html')
    tmpl.render(LANGUAGE='de_DE')

This example assumes that the translator returned by `get_translator`
already has a gettext and ngettext function that returns unicode strings.


Collecting Translations
=======================

The next step is to collect the translations. Every Jinja environment
provides a function called `get_translations` which collects all
translatable strings from an template.

Example:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> env.get_translations('index.html')
    [(1, u'foo', None), (2, u'Foo', None), (3, u'%(count)s Foo', u'%(count)s Foos')]

The first item in the tuple is the linenumer, the second one is the
singular form and the third is the plural form if given.

Because Jinja is not bound to gettext you can now use these strings to
create translation files for any translation system.

*New in Jinja 1.1* You can now extract translations from strings according
to the current envrionment settings too by using the environment method
`get_translations_for_string` which takes a string containing a template
as only argument. The return value is the same as for `get_translations`.
