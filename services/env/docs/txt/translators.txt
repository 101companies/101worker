Translators
===========

Jinja translates the template sourcecode into executable python code behind
the secenes. This is done by the python translator which is currently the
only shipped translator. Because the interface isn't stable it's also not
recommended yet to write other translators. However for one of the next Jinja
versions a JavaScript translator is planned which allows you to translate
Jinja templates into executable JavaScript code.
