# Development

## Running a module
Use `bin/run_module [moduleName]` to run a single Module. The Test-Environment
is specified in `config/test_folders.txt` which lists a number of directories
from 101results/101repo to be copied to 101test/. This mode sets OMIT_GITDEPS,
FULL_SWEEP and OMIT_PULL.

## Resource Derivation

An example module can be found at https://github.com/101companies/101worker/tree/development/modules/simpleLOC.
It counts the lines of code of every source file in 101repo.

## Dump Collection

An example module for this can be found at https://github.com/101companies/101worker/tree/development/modules/locPerContribution. This modules collects all Loc files and puts them into a per contribution dump.

## Third party Resource
An example module for this can be found at
https://github.com/101companies/101worker/tree/development/modules/extractFacts.
It takes a resource generated by another module to extract facts about the
source code.

## Wiki Dump
An example module for this can be found at
https://github.com/101companies/101worker/tree/development/modules/moretagclouds.
It parses the wiki dump and produces some tag clouds. These kinds of modules
are not incremental.
