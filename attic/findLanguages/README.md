# Headline

a module to associate contributions with language-related information

# Background

See the LaTaLa language: http://101companies.org/index.php/Language:LaTaLa

# Input/output behavior

The module reads LaTaLa files for all languages from
"101results/101repo/languages/*/.latala".  (In this manner, geshi ids
and file extensions are looked up for all languages.)  The module
writes "languages.json" files for all contributions to
"101results/contributions/*". The generated json files associate
language names as keys with file names and additional metadata as
values.

# Example

Consider the following input "101results/101repo/languages/Haskell/Haskell.latala":

<pre>
{
 "geshi" : "haskell",
 "extension" : ".hs"
}
</pre>

On these grounds, the module can determine the use of the language
Haskell within contributions. That is, files with extension ".hs" are
to be located. Also, it is clear that the language code "haskell" is
to be used for rendering Haskell files with geshi.

Consider the following output "101results/contributions/haskell/languages.json":

<pre>
{
 "Haskell" : {
  "geshi" : "haskell",
  "extension" : ".hs",   
  "file" : ["Company.hs", "Cut.hs", "Main.hs", "SampleCompany.hs", "Total.hs"]
 }
}
</pre>

The file has been generated by the present module. File names are
specified relative to the root directory of the contribution. Only one
language, i.e., "Haskell", has been inferred in this example.
