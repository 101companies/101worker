# Headline

a module to associate contributions with selected fragments.

# Background

See the FraTaLa language: http://101companies.org/index.php/Language:FraTaLa

# Input/output behavior

The module reads LaTaLa files for all languages from
"101results/101repo/contributions/*/.fratala". In this manner, the
fragment descriptions are obtained. The module writes "fragments.json"
files for all contributions to "101results/contributions/*". The
generated json files associate tags as keys with line ranges as
values.

# Example

Consider the following input "101results/101repo/contributions/haskell/.fratala":

<pre>
[
 {
  "tag" : "total",
  "file" : "Total.hs",
  "fragment" : {
   "function" : "total"
  }
 },
 {
  "tag" : "cut",
  "file" : "Cut.hs",
  "fragment" : {
   "function" : "cut"
  }
 }
]
</pre>

The module derives the following output "101results/contributions/haskell/fragments.json":

<pre>
[
 {
  "tag" : "total",
  "file" : "Total.hs",
  "from" : "5",
  "to" : "14"
 },
 {
  "tag" : "cut",
  "file" : "Cut.hs",
  "from" : "5",
  "to" : "14"
 }
}
</pre>

The file has been generated by the present module. File names are
specified relative to the root directory of the contribution.
